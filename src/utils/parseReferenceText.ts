    'anatomy': `# Wound Healing Phases
- Inflammatory (0 to 3 days): platelets then neutrophils then macrophages
- Proliferative (3 days to 3 weeks): fibroblasts; most collagen deposited
- Remodeling (3 weeks to 18 months): collagen III (most vascular) to I (MC in body)

# Healing
- Primary intention: directly closing a wound
- Secondary intention: open wound that closes from intact peripheral skin
- Epithelialization from intact hair follicles at wound edge, involving myofibroblasts
- Tertiary intention (rare): direct closure after leaving wound open for a few days

# Wound Closure

## Cyanoacrylate
- Use for short-distance, tension-free wounds with no significant tissue trauma or infection
- Higher dehiscence rate than sutures when put on longer incisions

## Sutures
- Minimize tissue trauma and foreign body burden with smaller suture sizes
- Monofilament suture: less tissue resistance
- Multi-filament suture
  - Braided, less memory, higher knot security, higher tensile strength
  - More likely to saw through tissue, harbor infection than monofilament
- Barbed suture: decreases operative time, no change in scar appearance in body contouring

# Scarring
- Technical: wound-edge eversion (#1 factor for healing)
- Silicone sheeting: Improves scar appearance by hydration, compression
- Pressure garments: Improves scarring in burn patients from reduced differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts

# Abnormal Scarring

## Hypertrophic scarring
- Stays within scar confines
- Histology: increased type III collagen, involves myofibroblasts; parallel collagen organization
- Tx: intralesional steroids + 5-FU

## Keloid
- Extends beyond scar
- Sx: pruritis, poor cosmesis
- RF: anterior chest, high Fitzpatrick skin type
- Histology: disorganized type I collagen; thick, randomly oriented collagen
- Tx: intralesional injection (mild cases)
  - 5-FU: similar efficacy, less hypopigmentation than steroids
  - MOA: decreases fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis
- Tx: surgery (moderate, severe cases)
  - Excision + steroid injection: 15% recurrence
  - Excision + XRT: 14% recurrence
  - Start XRT within 24 hours of excision, 2-3 sessions
  - Recurrence: male, age <29, size >5cm, associated skin graft

# Wound Management

## Local wound care
- Wet to dry: mechanically debrides metalloproteinases, elastases
- Hydrogels, hydrocolloids: maintain moist wound-healing environment
- Honey: stimulates immune response, suppresses inflammation
- Calcium alginate: absorptive, fewer dressing changes, provides moist-wound healing
- Hydrofiber: high absorptive capacity
- Occlusive dressings: moist-wound healing environment

## Negative-pressure wound therapy
- Micro- and macro-deformational forces
- Removes excess interstitial fluid, reopens capillaries, releases VEGF
- Evidence for fewer dressing changes and fewer operations in diabetic wounds
- Contraindications: exposed vessels, active infection, malignant wounds, non-debrided wounds

## Hyperbaric oxygen therapy
- Indications: carbon monoxide poisoning, arterial insufficiency, acute traumatic ischemia, radiation injury, necrotizing soft-tissue infections, refractory osteomyelitis

## Dermal regeneration template
- Composed of glycosaminoglycans, collagen
- Use associated with decreased hypertrophic scarring in burns

## Nutrition support
- Vitamin C: involved in collagen cross-linking
- Increased matrix metalloproteinases in wound bed associated with poor healing

# Abnormal Wound Healing

## Radiation Injury
- Acute: skin erythema; Tx: hydrocortisone cream
- Chronic: Fibrosis of soft tissues, decreased microvascular supply to skin
  - Limited ability to undermine or advance local tissues
  - Use regional or free tissue reconstructions out of zone of XRT injury

## Effect of nicotine on wound healing
- Peripheral microvascular vasoconstriction
- Inhibits prostacyclin
- Promotes increased platelet aggregation, impairs wounds healing by decreased oxygen delivery
- Improved wound healing after stopping smoking 4 weeks preoperatively
- Dx: urine cotinine testing

## Steroids
- Slows down inflammatory component of wound healing
- Tx: vitamin A (oral)

## Calciphylaxis
- Ischemic skin lesion due to calcification of small vessels
- Associated with ESRD
- Tx: sodium thiosulfate

# Pressure Injuries
- RF: males, spinal-cord injuries
- Staging:
  - I: transient erythema, self-resolves
  - II: dermis
  - III: subcutaneous to muscle fascia
  - IV: below muscle fascia, exposed bone
- Dx: bone biopsy -- more accurate than advanced imaging for osteomyelitis
- Consider abuse/neglect when multiple pressure injuries present
- Tx: debridement, local wound care, management of osteomyelitis/antibiotics
- Tx: flap coverage
  - Ischial: Posterior thigh musculocutaneous (paraplegic patients), posterior thigh fasciocutaneous (ambulatory patients), biceps femoris VY, gluteal, gracilis flaps
  - Sacral: Gluteal flap, VY advancement
  - Trochanteric: Tensor fascia lata myocutaneous flap (allows readvancement)
- Complications: Recurrence (50-70%)
- RF: hyperglycemia/uncontrolled diabetes (#1), osteomyelitis, paraplegic, age >70, immobility, poor nutrition, low BMI, anemia, ESRD, CVA, hip fracture
- Re-advance previous flaps when possible`,
    
    'skin-lesions': `# Skin

## Epidermis
- 5 layers (deep to superficial): Basal, spinosum, lucidum, granulosum, corneum
- Keratinocytes: Originate from basal layer, 90% of epidermis cells, acts as environmental barrier
- Melanocytes

## Dermis
- Papillary (superficial)
- Reticular (deep): Hair roots, sebaceous and sweat glands
- Predominantly made of type I collagen

# Benign Skin Conditions

## Hidradenitis suppurativa
- Apocrine gland involvement; forms subcutaneous fistulae from occlusion of folliculopilosebaceous units
- Tx: topical/oral antibiotics (1st line, mild cases), TNF-alpha inhibitors (2nd line, moderate cases)
- Tx surgical: excision of involved areas, reconstruction

## Dermoid cyst
- Most common childhood skin lesion

## Cylindromas
- Benign adnexal tumors
- Dx: firm, nodular, pink-colored scalp lesions
- Tx: excision`
