/**
 * Promotes bundled q-bank content into the database this process is connected to.
 *
 * Production runs on its own database that the workspace cannot reach, so content
 * authored in dev travels in the repo and is promoted here, on deploy.
 *
 * Production is the source of truth for existing questions: the audit agent revises them
 * and admins flag and hide them. Promotion is therefore insert-only — it adds questions
 * this database has never seen and never touches a row that already exists. A deliberate
 * overwrite is available through "npm run content:import", not from here.
 *
 * Set CONTENT_BOOTSTRAP=0 to skip entirely.
